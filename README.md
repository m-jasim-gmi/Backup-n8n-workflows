# n8n Workflow Collection

This repository contains a collection of workflow JSON files for [n8n](https://n8n.io/), an open-source workflow automation tool. These workflows can be imported into your n8n instance to automate various tasks and connect different applications and services.

## How to Use

1.  **Ensure you have an n8n instance:** You can either have a self-hosted n8n installation or an account on n8n Cloud.
2.  **Download the workflow JSON:** Choose a workflow from this repository and download its `.json` file.
3.  **Import into n8n:**
    *   In your n8n instance, go to your workflows.
    *   Click on the "Import from File" button.
    *   Select the downloaded `.json` file.
    *   The workflow will be imported, and you can then activate and configure it as needed (e.g., setting up credentials for the nodes).

## Workflows Included

This repository contains a variety of n8n workflows. The filenames are generally descriptive of the workflow's purpose. Some examples of the types of workflows you can find include:

*   **AI Voice Agents:** Automations for voice-based interactions, potentially integrating with services like Twilio and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems. (e.g., `ai-voice-agent-*.json`)
*   **Reporting Automation:** Workflows for generating reports from services like Google Analytics. (e.g., `automate-google-analytics-reporting-*.json`)
*   **Meeting Automation:** Tools to help automate aspects of scrum meetings or other meeting types. (e.g., `automate-scrum-meeting-*.json`)
*   **System Backups:** Workflows to back up n8n configurations themselves. (e.g., `n8n-backup-workflow-*.json`)
*   **Website Monitoring:** Automations to check website uptime and potentially other metrics. (e.g., `website-uptime-monitoring-*.json`)
*   **Communication & Onboarding:** Workflows for tasks like client onboarding emails. (e.g., `client_onboarding_email-*.json`)
*   **Content Generation:** Examples include WordPress template generation. (e.g., `wordpress-template-generation-*.json`)

Explore the repository to find workflows that might be useful for your needs.

## Prerequisites

While the workflow structures are provided in the JSON files, many workflows interact with external services and APIs. To use them, you will typically need to:

*   **Configure Credentials:** After importing a workflow into your n8n instance, you will need to configure the credentials for the various nodes (e.g., API keys for OpenAI, Google services, Telegram bots, etc.). n8n provides a secure way to store and manage these credentials.
*   **Adjust to Your Needs:** Workflows might require minor adjustments (e.g., specific email addresses, webhook URLs, Google Drive folder IDs) to fit your particular use case.
